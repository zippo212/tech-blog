## How to Use Our Next.js App
1. Clone the repository by running the command git clone https://github.com/zippo212/tech-blog.git in your terminal.

2. Navigate to the project directory by running cd [repository-name].

3. Install the necessary dependencies by running npm install or yarn install.

4. Start the development server by running npm run dev or yarn dev. This will start the server at http://localhost:3000 and will automatically reload the page as you make changes to the code.

5. To build the production version of the app, run npm run build or yarn build. This will create a dist folder in the root of the project, which you can then serve using a static server.

6. To run the tests, use npm run test or yarn test.

7. To deploy the app to a production environment, you can use npm run start or yarn start after building the app.

Note: Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine before running these commands.
